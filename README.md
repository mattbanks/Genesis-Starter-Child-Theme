## Summary

WordPress Starter Theme for use as Child Theme of the Genesis Framework for building custom themes, using Compass/SCSS and Grunt. Tested with WordPress 3.5.1 and Genesis 1.9.1.

## Usage

The theme is setup to use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to compile Compass/SCSS, lint, concatenate and minify JavaScript (with source maps), optimize images, with flexibility to add any additional tasks via the Gruntfile. Alternatively, you can use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/), [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) aor whatever else you prefer to compile the SCSS and manage the JavaScript.

Rename folder to your theme name, change the `assets/scss/style.scss` intro block to your theme information. Open the theme directory in terminal and run `npm install` to pull in all Grunt dependencies. Run `grunt` to execute tasks. Code as you will. To optimize images, run `grunt imagemin`.

- Compile `assets/scss/style.scss` to `style.css` (all paths defined in config.rb for Compass)
- Compile `assets/scss/editor-style.scss` to `editor-style.css`
- Concatenate and minify all plugins in `assets/js/vender` and `assets/js/source/plugins.js` to `assets/js/plugins.min.js`
- Minify `assets/js/source/main.js` to `assets/js/main.min.js`
